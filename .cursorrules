- Use TypeScript strictly
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- Prefer server components unless necessary
- Do not change existing folder structure without asking
- Explain risky changes before applying
- Always answer in Korean

When writing or editing code that includes Korean (Hangul) comments or strings:

- Always use UTF-8 encoding (without BOM).
- Do NOT change file encoding to EUC-KR, CP949, or other encodings.
- Assume all source files (.ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx, .json, .md) are UTF-8.
- Preserve existing Korean comments exactly; do not re-encode or replace characters.
- If a file appears corrupted, rewrite the Korean text explicitly in UTF-8 rather than copying garbled text.
- Never output escaped Unicode sequences (e.g. \uD55C\uAE00) for Korean text; write Hangul directly.
